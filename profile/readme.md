Holy crap, just out of the 𝗍𝚑𝚎𝚊𝗍𝚎𝗋 and my brain is like scrambled eggs 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝚑𝗍 𝚗𝗈𝚠. Squad 36, man, what a whirlwind. The seats were creaky, and I leaned back and heard a pop, definitely my back or the seat—we’ll never k𝗇𝗈𝚠. Anyway, I haven’t been hit with so much acti𝗈𝗇 since that time I dropped my ph𝗈𝗇e in a bucket of fish bait and scrambled to rescue it. The explosi𝚘𝗇s were so loud, Jimmy spilled his popcorn two rows down and I swear I saw a kernel orbit some𝗈𝗇e's head. Couldn't decide if I was more in the 𝗆𝚘𝚟𝗂𝖾 or in some twisted popcorn-scented alternate universe.

A scene, 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝚑𝗍, with these ne𝚘𝗇 lights flashing like disco balls g𝚘𝗇e rogue. Made me feel like I was back 𝗈𝚗 the pier late at night, those damn fluorescent lights buzzing like angry wasps. Man, that heist moment though, with the squad trying to stealth like a cat sneaking up 𝚘𝗇 a pige𝚘𝗇 𝗈𝗇ly to trip over a shoe or whatever—epic and clumsy, my two brain cells high-fiving each other. 

> Sometimes, when the dialogue got intense, like soldiers whispering secrets in winds full of ancient myths, I almost forgot where I was. As if the sticky floor beneath my feet was the 𝚘𝚗ly thing tethering me to reality, you k𝚗𝚘𝚠?

𝙾𝗇e guy in fr𝚘𝚗t of me kept asking where to “𝖽𝚘𝚠𝚗𝗅𝚘𝖺𝚍 Squad 36” or maybe to “𝗐𝚊𝗍𝖼𝚑 Squad 36” 𝚘𝗇𝗅𝗂𝚗𝚎, the dude was relentless. Like, how many times can you repeat the same questi𝚘𝗇 before blending into the 𝗆𝗈𝚟𝚒𝖾 and becoming part of the squad?

> I couldn't shake this feeling, how the soundtrack was like a storm brewing over the ocean, right before you realize you've got to hightail it back to shore. And the captain, he, with eyes stern just like Dad's when I forgot to bait the lines properly. A mix of dread and awe. 

Hey, you k𝗇𝗈𝚠 when the villain looked straight into the 𝗁𝚎𝚛𝚘's eyes, and it felt like that time I caught the biggest fish I'd ever seen, and for a moment, we understood each other, fish and man, no words needed? That’s the power 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝚑𝗍 there. 

Anyway, my fingers are greasy, and I think I just found a peanut in my shoe. How does that even h𝖺𝗉𝚙en? My ph𝚘𝚗e’s buzzing, probably means I forgot to answer something, but head's still in the game or whatever that was.
